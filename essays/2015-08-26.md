This a question that I found asking myself every start of a semester. The syllabi, assignments, exams, and a fear of the unknown all contribute to a sense of self doubt and overthinking that I tend to encounter routinely. This is especially true when it comes to learning a new coding language, and all the rules and syntax changes that come with it. All I can think about are the long hours and restless nights i'm about to spend trying to fix a bug in a program when the solution can be something as simple as missing a semi-colon or an extra bracket. 

And yet, I still find myself excited for software engineering. 

The ability to create using our conscience is something that seems so simple, but not other animal in the world creates like humans create. And the fact that we are creating things like websites, applications, and machines is amazing and all the more reason why I am so excited to learn about software engineering. It allows me to learn and experience the creation of things that I admire. 



## Another Tool in the Box

I grew up being a hardcore skateboarder, yelling "skate and destroy" while riding down the sidewalk with my long hair flowing in the wind. Although skateboarders tend to have a certain stigma associated with them, what I love about skateboarding is the ability to express your individuality with your set of tricks and deciding how you want to apply them. Whether its trying a grind down a rail in a way that no one has seen, or just mastering your tricks with near perfect consistency and execution. The reason I bring my past skateboarding ways up is because I think of coding very similarly to skateboarding.

I never used to think that design and technology went hand in hand.  Thus, learning about software engineering and the role of design has been incredibly interesting to me. Design, implementation, and management are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. Good art, in a way, makes a person question it. They become joined in the idea of visualization – where captivation meets inspiration.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
