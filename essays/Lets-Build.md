## Change

Up until the past two years, I never considered myself to be a computer person. When I first decided to go to college I majored in liberal arts, and I dreaded the fact that we would have to use a computer even for the most basic needs like using Laulima and email. I did enough just to get by. Fast forward to 2018, I decided to go back to school for computer science. *What made me change my mind?*

While I was researching some things on google to help enhance my gaming computer’s performance I stumbled across coding and software engineering. I was amazed that something like a website or application could be built using a language that seemed foreign to me. At the time I was working as a medical assistant, unhappy and looking for a fresh new start. And that’s when I decided that I’m going to go back to school.

## Blank Canvas.. or Screen?

After attending my first semester back in school I realized something; that I really like to code. As intimidating as it seemed, I enjoyed the ability to create something from scratch. Building websites, phone apps, and even assisting with designing an AI is something that is still very fascinating to me. From having a blank screen to having thousands of lines of code, each with its own specific function is a wild thought, and I enjoy the challenge of trying to accomplish that. Don’t get me wrong, I still have those nights where I am mentally defeated because I could not find an error that just turned out to be a curly bracket missing. It’s all worth it when the code is complete though. It’s a feeling that of satisfaction that I don’t get often, and that’s when I can take a step back and admire my hard work (of course after double checking the code). I also love software engineering because it can be helpful to others as well. I think of software engineering as a way for us to create technology so that other people can interact with that technology in a beneficial way. This can range from something as simple as having a user-friendly website, to building something that can benefit the world.

## Future

During my time at UH Manoa, I want to continue to build me skillset in the realm of software engineering. I want to learn as much languages that I can, develop more projects, experience multiple internships and environments, and become competent enough to be beneficial to the future of Hawaii and the world. Ultimately, before my time on Earth ends, I want to leave something that can benefit it for future generations. I know that software engineering can achieve that goal. It can allow me to create something that will help this world and people in it. Whether it’s helping with space exploration, the environment, or just creating websites that will make the lives of others just a tiny bit easier. As long as I know that I can make some sort of improvement in the world while satisfying my desire to build and create, I will continue to aspire to be the best software engineer that I can be. And hopefully in the process I will inspire others to do the same.
