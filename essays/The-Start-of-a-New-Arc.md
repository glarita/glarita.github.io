## Excitement

*Am I good enough?*

This a question that I found asking myself every start of a semester. The syllabi, assignments, exams, and a fear of the unknown all contribute to a sense of self-doubt and overthinking that I tend to encounter routinely. This is especially true when it comes to learning a new coding language, and all the rules and syntax changes that come with it. All I can think about are the long hours and restless nights I’m about to spend trying to fix a bug in a program when the solution can be something as simple as missing a semi-colon or an extra bracket. 

And yet, I still find myself excited for software engineering. 

The ability to create using our conscience is something that seems so simple, but not other animal in the world creates like humans create. And the fact that we are creating things like websites, applications, and machines is amazing and all the more reason why I am so excited to learn about software engineering. It allows me to learn and experience the creation of things that I admire. 



## Another Tool in the Box

Like any other language, Javascript is a bit difficult for me to catch on to right away, but I did find it to be a bit easier than the past languages I have learned due to its more simplistic nature. Although, it doesn’t mean that it won’t come with its headaches. 
 
I grew up being a hardcore skateboarder, yelling "skate and destroy" while riding down the sidewalk with my long hair flowing in the wind. Although skateboarders tend to have a certain stigma associated with them, what I love about skateboarding is the ability to express your individuality with your set of tricks and deciding how you want to apply them. Whether it’s trying a grind down a rail in a way that no one has seen, or just mastering your tricks with near perfect consistency and execution. The reason I bring up my past skateboarding ways is because I think of coding very similarly to skateboarding.

Learning more coding languages is like learning more tricks, and having more tricks gives you more versatility to be creative and express your individuality. I’m not the fastest learner when it comes to coding, but I enjoy the challenge of mastering it to the best of my abilities so that I can express myself. 

## Workouts and Athleticism

Exercise is good for the body, but a lot of times people neglect the most important thing to exercise, *your brain*.

I definitely find WODS challenging, especially with the limited time that we have for them. Although they can be stressful, it is exactly what I need in order to propel myself to the next level. Experiencing the pressure of a time limit will have its benefits for the real world, where there are deadlines all the time. It trains me to think quicker and remain calm, while also thinking about how I am going to solve the problem given to us. 

I feel the same way when it comes to athletic software engineering. It is a lot to do within a certain period of time, but I think it will be beneficial for me in the end. 

## Onward

Computer science is a challenging field. There are so many variables and so much to learn. Although I know software engineering is by no means an easy path to choose, I believe that it will be well worth it. Learning Javascript and having the opportunity to create projects and enhance my skills feels like I’m starting a new arc to my story, and to that I say onward!
