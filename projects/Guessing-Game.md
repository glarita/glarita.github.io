In my first semester as an ICS student I didn't know what to expect, but I did know that I wanted to created some sort of game. This project is an example of the first game that I created using the Java language in JGrasp. Although it is only a mini game, and there is not graphical interface, I still enjoyed the process of creating it. The purpose of the game is simple; to guess a number from 1 - 10. The program uses a random number generator to generate a random number and store it into a variable. Then it will compare the number with the user's input. If the number is too high or too low, then it returns a message stating to try again. The program incorporates a loop that will continue until the user guesses the correct number. Once the correct number is inputted, the user wins and the program ends. 

Although this is a simple game to program, it helped me develop my knowledge of Java that I carry with me today. It displays my ability to think critically, despite being only a few months into school as an ICS student. It also shows my problem solving skills, as well as my ability to document my code adequately and properly name variables at such an early stage of my coding journey.

Here is some lines of code from the loop and if-else statements:
```js
 while (keepTrying) {
         
         
         // Scanner is declared and intialized within the beginning of the loop so that
         // the program gives another chance for the user to enter in another guess 
         // with every iteration. This also prevents garbage.
         Scanner reader = new Scanner (System.in);
         
         // A try-catch is used so that if the user enters anything other than an integer an 
         // error message is shown.
         try {
            System.out.println("Guess a number from 1-10.");
            System.out.print("> ");
            
            // The users guess and input is stored into a variable.
            userGuess = reader.nextInt();
           
           // an if-else and else if is used to create a condition for the inputted number
           // by the user. This will let the user know if the number they guessed is too high,
           // too low, or the correct guess.
            if (userGuess > correctNum) {
               System.out.println( userGuess + " is too high. Try again");
            } else if (userGuess < correctNum) {
                 System.out.println(userGuess + " is too low. Try again");    
            }
            
            else {
               System.out.print(userGuess + " is correct! good job!"); 
               
               // Boolean variable will be reassigned here when the user gets the correct answer. 
               // This will end the while loop.
               keepTrying = false;
            }
```
