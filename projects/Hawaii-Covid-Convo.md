My first semester at UH Manoa was a tough one. There was a significant jump in difficulty for my classes, and the semester was amongsth the COVID-19 pandemic, so all classes were taught online. But there once class stood out to me, and that was ICS 314, software engineering. I did not know what to expect for the class, but I knew that it would be difficult and intense. Fast forward to the end of the semester I realized that I really had fun developing in the class. For our final project we had to create a fully functional web application that would allow us to demonstrate the skills we learned in the class. We were to work in groups of four people, and choose one application out of the many options we were given to try and create. Our group ended up choosing to create a Hawaii COVID-19 chatbot application that allowed users to ask the chat-bot a questions regarding COVID-19, where they would recieve an answer to the question.
