When I made a switch from playing video games on a ps4 console to a gaming PC, I made a video on the changes that I experienced. The video game I used as a reference is called Fortnite: Battle Royale. I documented over the course of about a month my progress, and the pros and cons that I experienced with my switch from console gaming to PC gaming. The biggest difference between console gaming and PC gaming is the use of controllers to mouse and keyboard. This video required me to use applications like Photoshop, and a video-editing application called Wondershare Filmora. It also required me to become more familiar with the screen recording application OBS.

Editing this video improved my technical skills, especially with Photoshop and Wondershare Filmora. I had previously not used Photoshop nor any video editing applications, but once I started to use it more frequently I become more comfortable and it helped me develop a better sense of how editing applications work. Because the purpose of this video was to go over my progress and recognize the differences between the two systems, it helps display my ability to analyze and pay attention to detail such as the differences in player skill level and the differences on how mechanics of the game can provide an advantage or disadvantage for both systems. It also displays my communication skills, and my ability to provide information in a way that others are able to easily understand.
