When I made a switch from playing video games on a ps4 console to a gaming PC, I made a video on the changes that I experienced. The video game I used as a reference is called Fortnite: Battle Royale. I documented over the course of about a month my progress, and the pros and cons that I experienced with my switch from console gaming to PC gaming. The biggest difference between console gaming and PC gaming is the use of controllers to mouse and keyboard. This video required me to use applications like photoshop, and a video-editing application called Wondershare Filmora. It also required me to become more familiar with the screen recording application OBS.
