## What I Created

When I made a switch from playing video games on a ps4 console to a gaming PC, I made a video on the changes that I experienced. The video game I used as a reference is called Fortnite: Battle Royale. I documented over the course of about a month my progress, and the pros and cons that I experienced with my switch from console gaming to PC gaming. The biggest difference between console gaming and PC gaming is the use of controllers to mouse and keyboard. This video required me to use applications like Photoshop, and a video-editing application called Wondershare Filmora. It also required me to become more familiar with the screen recording application OBS.

## What I Learned

At the time I was new to using all of this software. It was the first time I had ever owned my own personal computer, so it was a challenge figuring out how to navigate through the OS, learning how to edit photos using photoshop, and edit videos using Filmora. I did a lot of research, looking up videos on how to use these applications to produce the type of content that I was aiming for. In the process I learned the difficulties that came with video editing (such as making sure audio is properly aligned with the clips and knowing when to and where to implement certain video clips so that it would give the viewer a better understanding of message), but I also found that it was something that I enjoyed doing as well. 

## Skills Developed and Required

Editing this video improved my technical skills, specifically with navigating through the windows OS on my computer, and using photo and video editing applications. Once I started to use these editing software applications more frequently, I became more comfortable and it helped me develop a better sense of how editing applications work, and I even created more videos of my gameplay. Because the purpose of this video was to go over my progress and recognize the differences between the two systems, it also helped to improve my ability to analyze and pay attention to detail such as the differences in player skill level and the differences on how mechanics of the game can provide an advantage or disadvantage for both systems. It also helped with my speaking skills, and my ability to provide information in a way that others are able to easily understand.
