During my time working as an After-School Aplus program leader at Pearl City Elementary school, we would do yearly projects with our specified group of students called "Finales". These finales consisted of students performing in front of an audience, all of which were parents, staff, or other students. The purpose of the finales were to help students focus on arts and creativity and the performances usually consisted of either singing or dancing. It also helps students to build coordination skills, teamwork skills, and to overall just have fun. My role in these finales as a group leader was to help coordinate these finales, and to teach the students how to dance and about performing in front of others.
